#     --image $IMAGE \
#     --public-key key.pub \
#     --policy github.com/enterprise-contract/config//everything
#
# To use with an Konflux Enterprise Contract Integration Test CR:
#   ...
#   spec:
#     params:
#     - name: POLICY_CONFIGURATION
#       value: github.com/enterprise-contract/config//everything
#     ...
